 - [Create question evaluation without approval/rejection](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/05b5afb705beafce658482c429ef813969f9f72b/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/createQuestionEvaluation.js#L38)

 - [Test search bar](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/05b5afb705beafce658482c429ef813969f9f72b/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/createQuestionEvaluation.js#L72)
##### Functionality: List student questions
 - [Create 2 questions and check if they are listed](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/05b5afb705beafce658482c429ef813969f9f72b/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/listStudentQuestions.js#L10)
 - [Test search bar](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/05b5afb705beafce658482c429ef813969f9f72b/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/studentQuestion/listStudentQuestions.js#L26)

#### Rationale
We consider that our tests cover the most significant use cases of our application (creating student questions and question evaluations, viewing them, and displaying error messages when users forget to fill some fields). The tests related to the search bar may be very a little less significant for a small number of student questions in the database, but with a large number it is essential to assure the search functionality works.

- [login and see a clarification associated with an answered question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/ddp/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/seeClarification.js)


#### Rationale

 The aim of theses tests to replicate the real behaviour that the application should display when a real user is using it. In the "Create Clarification Request Feature' tests, simulates a user(a student) answering a quiz, and then requesting some clarification for the questions he answered. Next, in  the 'Create Clarification Feature' tests another user(a teacher) browses through the course questions and picks one with a clarification request associated it. Then he reads a doubt asked by the student, and provides a clarification to the student's doubt. Finally, int the 'Get Clarification Feature' test, the student will navigate to his solved quizzes page where he will select one and then select a question he answered and requested a clarification for and see the teacher's answer.
