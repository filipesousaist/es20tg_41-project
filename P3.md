##### Create Clarification Request Feature
 - [login answer a quiz and try to create a clarification request for the first question without title](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/492275fe66f68616ab45136f7f6483edc14cbe07/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/createClarificationRequests.js#L11)

##### Get Clarification Feature
- [login and see a clarification associated with an answered question](https://github.com/tecnico-softeng/es20tg_41-project/blob/ddp/frontend/tests/e2e/specs/student/seeClarification.js)



#### Rationale

 The aim of theses tests to replicate the real behaviour that the application should display when a real user is using it. In the "Create Clarification Request Feature' tests, simulates a user(a student) answering a quiz, and then requesting some clarification for the questions he answered. Next, in  the 'Create Clarification Feature' tests another user(a teacher) browses through the course questions and picks one with a clarification request associated it. Then he reads a doubt asked by the student, and provides a clarification to the student's doubt. Finally, int the 'Get Clarification Feature' test, the student will navigate to his solved quizzes page where he will select one and then select a question he answered and requested a clarification for and see the teacher's answer.
